      "reference_answer": "Maria from HR asks developer Phil to support an employee’s legal name change not tied to marital status. Phil never implemented this because it was never specified, revealing a gap in elicitation and documentation. Wiegers uses this story to show that many failures stem from misunderstood or unstated requirements, not code defects. The case highlights the cost of assumptions, the need for early stakeholder collaboration, and the value of writing requirements down. Clear scope, validation, and change control prevent last‑minute surprises, rework, and user frustration."

      "reference_answer": "The Maria–Phil exchange illustrates a classic requirements breakdown: users assume capabilities are obvious while developers implement only what is explicitly requested. The HR system allowed name changes only when marital status changed, blocking a legal name change for other reasons. This was not a ‘bug’ but an omission born of informal communication, implied functionality, and missing documentation. Wiegers generalizes from this vignette: requirements errors—ambiguities, assumptions, and unmanaged changes—account for a large share of software defects and late churn. The remedy is disciplined practices: structured elicitation, traceable documentation, stakeholder alignment, and validation before construction. By distinguishing needs from design, agreeing on scope, and managing changes, teams reduce rework and deliver solutions that address real business problems. The story underscores that requirements quality is foundational to product quality and delivery predictability."

Change requests may be lost without status tracking, and implemented features can go unused if they are misaligned with needs.
