    "generated_output": "The paper critiques common requirement paths: sugarcoating design, output specification, featurism, and assumption without validation. It advocates stating goals first, expressing them testably against domain invariants and constraints. An explicit product boundary exposes environmental behavior the machine cannot change, reducing management frustration. Rigorous scope discipline enables earlier risk detection and deferral of low‑value features, decreasing noise in design and prioritization. Operational concepts clarify usage and problem context, anchoring requirements in real‑world need. By separating problem from solution, teams gain flexibility to explore architectures that meet requirements optimally. The approach integrates well with iterative and agile methods by reducing churn from unclear objectives and facilitating incremental risk reduction.",
    "reference_answer": "RE reduces late change by clarifying needs early. Elicitation surfaces needs; analysis & negotiation reconcile conflicts; specification records decisions in testable form; validation checks quality and agreement; management governs change, status, and versions. The art side involves communication and context; the science side uses standards and measurable criteria.

He distinguishes the environment (subject matter and purposes) from the machine, emphasizing that the requirements problem is primarily a problem of expressing and constraining this environment-machine relationship. Concepts of domain, phenomenon, requirement, specification, and design separate what the system must achieve from how it achieves it. Problems like partitioned views, premature solution focus, undetected inconsistencies, and elided conditions lead teams to deliver compliant but inadequate systems. A disciplined, multi-view RE process surfaces contradictions and gaps before coding begins. Information hiding, application design, and acceptance criteria provide late‑binding flexibility and measurable closure on delivery items. By maintaining this separation and delaying binding to implementation, teams gain clearer scope, better tradeoffs, and reduced rework.",

    "generated_output": "Karl Wiegers’s framework centers the twin delusions of completeness and accuracy as barriers to shared understanding. By listing every type of requirement, teams expose gaps and ambiguities early, reducing rework. Wiegers distinguishes between elicitation (uncovering needs), specification (documenting in testable form), and validation (confirming stakeholders’ intent). This taxonomy supports parallel development, early V&V, and scope control. Wiegers refutes faith in single‑source truth: needs change, interpretations vary, and documentation can be wrong. Instead, he advocates for incremental discovery, wide review, and traceability from need to test. His principles shift the culture from building everything imagined to delivering what maximizes user value within constraints.",

Difference between conflict and ambiguity?\n\nA) Conflict forces choice; ambiguity allows diverse interpretation.\n\nB) Ambiguity comes from scope creep.\n\nC) Conflict requires usability testing.\n\nD) No difference, just different labels.\n\nAnswer Key:\n\n1. B\n\n2. B\n\n3. A\n\nExplanations:\n\n1B: The SRS defines what the software will do, not just how it’s implemented.\n\n2B: Criteria establish when elicitation can end and analysis can proceed.\n\n3A: Conflict demands selection among alternatives; ambiguity supports multiple conflicting interpretations.",

      "raw_evaluation": "CORRECTNESS: 9\nThe generated questions are technically correct and align with the concepts related to stakeholder theory, requirements, and resource planning. However, the answer explanations could be slightly clearer.\n\nCOMPLETENESS: 8\nThe generated output includes three fully developed questions with corresponding answer options, answers, and brief explanations. It covers aspects of stakeholder theory, requirements comparison, and resource management but does not tackle pre- and post-requirement traceability directly, as seen in the reference.\n\nCLARITY: 8\nMost of the questions and explanations are clear. However, some terminology, such as \"I-Type,\" \"T-Type,\" and \"P-Type,\" might not be immediately understandable without context.\n\nRELEVANCE: 7\nWhile the questions are relevant to the broader theme of requirements and stakeholder management, they do not directly correspond to the specific topics covered in the reference sample, which focuses more on traceability.\n\nOVERALL: 8\nThe questions are well-constructed and informative, although they could be better aligned with the exact scope of the reference answer. Improvements in clarity and contextual relevance to traceability would enhance the overall quality.\n\nREASONING: The generated questions are adequately challenging and touch on critical elements of project management and requirements, akin to medium difficulty multiple-choice questions. However, a close alignment with the reference topic could provide a more precise measurement of relevant skills and knowledge."
